# Scrum

- Scrum is a project management methodology that focuses on delivering work incrementally through [Development Sprints](#development-sprint), which are short, time-boxed periods where the team builds specific features or tasks without extensive upfront planning or designing. 
- Builds the product incrementally, continuously improving until the entire product is complete.

## Development Sprint
- A development sprint is a **short, fixed period of time** (mostly between 1-4 weeks) when team members focus on building a few features that become part of the product. 
- A development sprint starts with [Sprint Planning](#sprint-planning).
- After [Sprint Planning](#sprint-planning), the [Sprint](#sprint) begins.
- During the workday, team members participate in the [Daily Scrum](#daily-scrum).
- Every sprint has to create something useful called [Increments](#increments).
- At the end of the development sprint, there will be a [Sprint Review](#sprint-review).
- After the [Sprint Review](#sprint-review), the Scrum team holds a [Sprint Retrospective](#sprint-retrospective) to identify improvements.

### Sprint Planning
- A stage to plan and design the product that team members need to build. 
- Managed by the [Product Owner](#product-owner) and facilitated by the [Scrum Master](#scrum-master).
- Team members select items from the [Product Backlog](#product-backlog) they think can complete before the end of the development sprint.
- Never spend too much time on planning.
- Never plan too far into the future.

#### Product Owner
- The Product Owner is the person who owns and is responsible for the product vision and has a list of [Product Backlog](#product-backlog) items.
- Prioritizes what needs to be developed to build the product.

##### Product Backlog
- A list of things that need to be developed to build the product.

#### Scrum Master
- Organizes and manages the scrum process and ensures that the team follows scrum practices.
- Acts as the middle person between the Product Owner and team members.
- Communicates everything and helps to remove obstacles and improve productivity.

### Sprint
- The development team works to complete a set of specific tasks or features from the project backlog.
- Allows the team to deliver small, incremental improvements to the product regularly.

#### Increments
- A list of features that will become a part of the final product.

### Daily Scrum
- A short, daily meeting for the development team to discuss progress and plan the day's work.

### Sprint Review
- A meeting held at the end of the sprint to review the work completed and the progress made.

### Sprint Retrospective
- A meeting held after the Sprint Review to discuss what went well, what didn't, and how to improve in the next sprint.
